0.201:
- Oopsie-release: The last one was missing pre-built binaries in the release
  tarball.
- Use AFDKO's `tx` to compress the variable font in roughly half.

0.200:
- (The design points below are mostly the result of design reviews by Alexei
  Vanyashin, Jacques Le Bailly and Stephen Nixon, in no particular order).
- Respacing of uppercase letters in the regular master and complete thin and
  extra bold masters. Uppercase letters space better next to lowercase letters
  now. Cyrillics are more consistently spaced.
- Tweak numerals some. Especially the "one" and fractions.
- Various tweaks to various shapes across the board, especially symbols. Braces
  are curlier now. Detail tweaks to Cyrillics.
- Basic mathy symbols and currency symbols now have tabular number width. I found
  no advantage to having proportional variants.
- Removed .tosf numerals. Fiddly work without clear purpose.
- Experimental alternative form of "l" without the tail, contributed by Jacques
  Le Bailly. Accessible via the ss01 feature.
- Added variable font, CFF2 flavor. postscriptBlueFuzz is set to 1 explicitly
  to avoid rounding issues with blue zone coverage in FreeType.
- Removed f-ligatures without their own Unicode code points, as the design doesn't
  currently need them. They were mainly added to fill up the Google glyph set.
- The following glyphs now represent more than one Unicode code point to keep the
  glyph view tidier:
    emdash: U+2014, U+2015
    emspace: U+2001, U+2003
    enspace: U+2000, U+2002
    hyphen: U+002D, U+00AD, U+2010, U+2011
    space: U+0020, U+00A0
  In PDFs where the generator removed the text stream, copy-paste may lead to the
  others turning into the first. Meh.
- Filled in hryvnia (U+20B4), tugrik (U+20AE) and tenge (U+20B8).
- Static fonts use same rounding method as varLib uses for the variable font.
- Fixed Ustraight-cy (U+04AE), ustraight-cy (U+04AF), Ustraightstroke-cy
  (U+04B0), ustraightstroke-cy (U+04B1), they didn't have a proper production
  name before and may not have been properly accessible.
- Removed some building components that made it into the final font.
- Limited anchor propagation to letters, excluding ligatures. Generate GDEF
  table properly.
- Set one simple `gasp` table for hinted display for e.g. Windows.
- Removed `ccmp` from the `aalt` lookup.
- The OS/2 table fsType now says that no Digital Rights Management is applied
  to the fonts, the name table now says the fonts are OFL 1.1 licensed.
- Internal housekeeping: Sources are stored in the open UFO and Designspace format
  now, with various cleanups like removed unused layers.
- Internal housekeeping: Removed composite diacritics that served no design purpose.

0.111
- Fix the wrongly assigned OS/2 weight class values that e.g. led to Extra Bold
  being selected when Bold was requested.

0.110
- Space everything a little bit tighter.
- Scale down whiteCircle and blackCircle by 50%, makes password dots smaller.
- Tweak feet of one.lf slightly for a more even appearance.
- Revise lcaron, dcaron and tcaron for collision-free rendering even at bold
  weight. Will need kerning later.
- Add draft of Cyrillic (GF Cyrillic Plus set), to be improved.
- Equalize advance width of period, comma, colon, semicolon.
- Build packages with prebuilt fonts baked in.
- New contributed AppStream metadata translations for Slovak (Dušan Kazik),
  Slovenian (Matej Urbančič), Russian (Stas Solovey) and Chinese China
  (Dingzhong Chen).
